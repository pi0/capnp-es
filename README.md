> TypeScript implementation of the [Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org) serialization protocol.

> [!WARNING]
> This is an alpha-quality software. please use at your own risk ([project status](#status)).

Capâ€™n Proto is an insanely fast data interchange format and capability-based RPC system. Think JSON, except binary. Or think [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf), except faster. Capâ€™n Proto was built by [Kenton Varda](https://github.com/kentonv) to be used in [Sandstorm](https://capnproto.org/faq.html#sandstorm) and is now heavily used in [Cloudflare](https://capnproto.org/faq.html#cloudflare). Start with the [Cap'n Proto Introduction](https://capnproto.org/index.html) for more detailed information on what this is about.

## Usage

### Compiling schema

Make sure `capnpc` command is available. You can find install instructions [here](https://capnproto.org/install.html) to install it.

Run the following to compile a schema file into typeScript/javascript source code:

```shell
npx capnp-es --ts --dts --js path/to/myschema.capnp
```

or

```shell
capnpc -o- path/to/myschema.capnp | npx capnp-es --ts --dts --js
```

This will generate `path/to/myschema.{ts,d.ts,js}` (ESM syntax).

See [playground](./playground/) for examples and learn more about `.capnp` schema in capnp language [docs](https://capnproto.org/language.html).

### Reading Messages

Here's a quick usage example:

```ts
import * as capnp from "capnp-es";
import { MyStruct } from "./myschema.js";

const message = capnp.Message.fromArrayBuffer(buffer);
const struct = message.getRoot(MyStruct);
```

### RPC Protocol

Experimental [RPC protocol](https://capnproto.org/rpc.html) is supported ([level 1](https://capnproto.org/rpc.html#protocol-features).)

## Status

This project is a rework<sup>1</sup> of [jdiaz5513/capnp-ts](https://github.com/jdiaz5513/capnp-ts/) by JuliÃ¡n DÃ­az and is under development.

**<sup>1</sup> Changes from `capnp-ts`:**

- [x] Internal refactors and simplifications as was playing around.
- [x] Compiler, runtime, and std lib published via a single and compact ESM-only package with subpath exports.
- [x] Compiler updated to use Typescript v5 API
- [x] Output files can be `.ts` (new), `.js` (ESM instead of CJS), and `.d.ts` and has no `.capnp` suffix.
- [x] Compiler API can be used via the `capnp-es/compiler` subpath export programmatically.
- [x] Use native `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` for utf8 encoding
- [x] Enums are typed plain JS objects (this way `.ts` files work with strip-only ts loaders without enum support.)
- [x] Compiler CLI can directly accept a path to `.capnp` files and internally use `capnpc`
- [x] Built-in schemas are compiled from source (compiler, compiles itself. so cool right?)
- [x] Use reflection (getter setters) to access structs.
- [x] RPC level 1
- [ ] [TODO] Investigate runtime performance. Some language features make full traverse slow, especially on Node.js < 22, Bun is fast and all good.
- [ ] [PLANNED] Investigate the possibility of bundling the wasm version of `capnp`
